<h3>The difference between earning income and generating income</h3>

- B and I quadrants are not about earning more income. They're about earning assets that generate income.
- Wealth does not mean how much money you have. It means how long you can survive without working.
- When you build a business, you are building an asset. Instead of earning income, you build an asset - and the asset generates income.
- If it makes you money, it is an asset. If it takes money from you, it is a liability.

<h3>Network marketing</h3>

- The whole point is not the sell a product but to build a network - people who all represent the same product or service to share with others.
- The goal is not for you or another individual to sell a lot of product.
- The goal is for a lot of people to be their own best customer, sell and service a reasonable number of customers, and recruit and show a lot of other people how to do the same thing.
- By having a network, you will be able to create passive income.
- Network marketing is not about earning more income; it's about building an asset.

<h2>#1 Real world business education</h2>

- An attitude of success
- Dressing for success
- Overcoming the fear of rejection
- Communication skills
- People skills
- Time-management skills
- Accountability skills
- Practical goal-setting
- Money-management skills
- Investing skills

<h2>#2 Personal Development</h2>

- Going out of your comfort zone to learn real-world business skills
- Learning how to overcome self-doubts and persevere.

<h2>#3 Your circle of friends</h2>

- Your income tends to be about equalto the average income of your five closest friends.
- Become acutely aware of who you spend your time with and who your teachers are.
- Find teachers who value freedom and financial freedom, rather than security and a steady paycheck.

<h2>#4 The power of your own network</h2>
- Jeff Bexos didn't publish books - he created the online network Amazon that delivers those books
- Bull Gates didn't build computers - he built the distribution network that delivers the goods
- Network marketing allows you to build your own network rather than spend your life working for someone else's network
- Metcalfe's law - grow the network by duplicating yourself into someone else just like you: a partner

<h2>#5 A duplicable fully scalable asset</h2>
- Most successful network marketers are people who enjoy telling stories and helping others
- Network marketing is about sharing information and personal stories, and not about hard selling
- Place mmore emphasis on showing everyone how to duplicate their efforts in the performance of others
- Connect with people, invite them to experience the products you are excited about and take a look at the information you have, and follow up with them
- Once they have joined the business, you share your enthusiasm, experiences, and help them learn to do what you have learned to do

<h2>#6 Leadership Skills</h2>
- The power to make things happen through the sheer force of the vision you share
- Often businesses fail due to the leader failing to communicate the company's vision
- Those who are successful often have a passion for teaching and helping their fellow human beings
- Mental, emotional, physical and spiritual leadership  are required to be successful in business
- If you cannot help your employees develop these skills, you will also fail

<h2>#7 Generating wealth</h2>
- Wealth is not measured by the size of income, but by time
- If you stopped working today, how long could you live financially?
- The richest don't work to generate income - but to build wealth (and buy time)
- Build a business to generate money, reinvest money back into the business to grow it further
- To invest in your business involved on training and educating yourself, on travel to support your growing network in other cities, on promotional and education tools and resources to help nourish the business
- Network marketing's capital investment is not your time and money but your time and effort
- Use supplemental income from business to invest in real estate - comes after building business and reinvesting, only to be done when you have the extra cash
- Purpose of buying real estate is not to sell it; the purpose of buying real estate is to build an income-generating asset
- Let your assets buy luxuries
- Use your income to build your assets - your business and real estate investments - and then, once they're sufficiently built, you let them buy your luxuries

<h2>#8 Dream Big</h2>
- Don't just have dreams, live those dreams
- Ask HOW you can afford it: "I can't affort it" > "How can I afford it?"
- If you want to change who you are, begin by changing the size of your dream
- Being poor is a mindset, being broke is only temporary ****
- No matter how broke you might be, the only way you will become poor is by giving up on your dreams
